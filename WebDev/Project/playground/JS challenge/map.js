//Challenge 1

//Use the map method on the numbers array given at line 2 to add 5 to each number and put the results into a new array.The code has been started for you at line 3.

//Challenge 2

//Use the map method on the same numbers array to turn it into an array of strings, and add a colon and a space after each number.The code has been started for you at line 7.

//Challenge 3

//Use the map method on the words array on line 13 to remove the "s" from the end of each word.The code has been started for you in line 14. Hint: Research the use of the String.slice() method to remove the final letter from a string.There are other String methods that could also be used.

   // Challenge 4

//Use the map method on the words array from line 13 to return an array with just the first letter of each word.The code has been started for you on line 19.

//Bonus Challenge

//Use the map method on the words array to return an array with just the first letter of each word capitalized(along with the rest of the word in lower case
